# NumericMatrixProcessor

## About
Hereâ€™s a project for devoted matrix enthusiasts: learn to perform a variety of operations on matrices including addition, multiplication, finding the determinant, and dealing with inverse matrices. If you are working on your tech or math major, this project is a good chance for you to learn matrices in action and not just in your notebook.
## Learning outcomes
Apart from learning a whole lot about matrices, you will become familiar with the Math library, recursion, and the many ways of using arrays in practice.


## Example
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.
```
1. Add matrices
2. Multiply matrix by a constant
3. Multiply matrices
4. Transpose matrix
5. Calculate a determinant
6. Inverse matrix
0. Exit
Your choice: > 6
Enter matrix size: > 3 3
Enter matrix:
> 2 -1 0
> 0 1 2
> 1 1 0
The result is:
 0.33   0  0.33
-0.33   0  0.66
 0.16 0.5 -0.33
